      <p><em>Originally written October 2019</em></p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s an update about everything in my non-work life, which for once is actually a very significant part of my life!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m loving my apartment. We got a 4th roommate and her name is Genesis. She is from Venezuela but has lived in Spain for a few years and knows so much about life here that I am clueless about. For example, one night she suggested ordering in food, which I had somehow not realized was something you could do in Spain. And then she proceeded to show me 4 or 5 different apps that I had no idea existed.</p>

<p>In terms of other friends, I&rsquo;ve gotten to know Aparna, a woman in Aiko&rsquo;s intensive 20-hours-a-week Spanish class. She&rsquo;s a professional yoga instructor from India and here to learn Spanish to take her yoga business to other countries (I&rsquo;m being exposed to so many meaningful things people do with their lives that would have never occurred to me back at Dartmouth). Aparna, Aiko and I all go to the same gym and have had fun exploring the city together.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how everyone I hang out with is at least about 4 years older than me - such a change from college! I&rsquo;m enjoying meeting new people, but I still feel pretty connected to people far away (my favorite times of the day are tied between when I have my afternoon cup of coffee and when my family and close friends Sarah and Sean wake up and text me every day without fail). I&rsquo;m also enjoying having more time to myself.</p>
<p>It has been so cool to live and work with people from completely varied backgrounds. Almost every day at lunch with my labmates, we fall into talking about a given subject and how it compares in Spain vs the US vs France (we have a postdoc from Nice) - meal sizes/times, how leaders are elected, mushrooms, coffee, PhD programs, cheese, really anything&hellip;it&rsquo;s funny how the smallest things can be so different from place to place. And the small things really matter. For example, I&rsquo;ve noticed that people here care more about waiting for others. If we&rsquo;re walking back from a group meeting or lunch and someone for any reason wants to have a quick conversation with someone, we all wait for them and then walk back to our lab together. While this action is unnatural to me after a lifetime in America, I love the concept and practice of treating people like they are more important than maximal productivity.</p>
<p>Today during our post-lunch coffee break (a daily ritual here), we were talking about stereotypes people have about other countries. Someone said that Spain is known as being all about &ldquo;siesta and fiesta&rdquo; and honestly&hellip;not an inaccurate way to describe my life. I&rsquo;m actually learning how to chill! (I do have some problems with the concept of &ldquo;chill&rdquo; the way it is frequently used, but I think that relaxing is nice.) When I was in college, I would do work all the time, even on breaks. But now, I&rsquo;ve actually decided to stop working when I leave work, and to relax over the weekends, and to prioritize my sleep and health and friendships over or at least on par with work. I know that there&rsquo;s so much more to life than work, but I haven&rsquo;t always lived my life that way, and right now is the perfect time for me to develop a sustainable balance. I left Dartmouth so burnt out and don&rsquo;t want to feel the same way during/after my PhD, because life is too short to be exhausted and stressed out all the time.</p>
<p>Speaking Spanish has been an adventure. I have a certain sense of humor in English, and I also have a sense of humor in Spanish (or maybe I just make people laugh by sounding stupid), but they&rsquo;re distinct. The way I form thoughts in English is so different from how I have to think through Spanish, and speaking a lot of Spanish has deepened my appreciation of the ease of speaking in my native language. I feel like my Spanish is improving but not as much as I want it to. When I speak with groups of Spainards, I still have a hard time understanding what they are saying, and coming up with responses in the pace of the conversation. When I speak one-on-one with people, I can have a pretty full conversation and am sometimes surprised at perfect phrases I whip out, but there&rsquo;s a depth at which I can&rsquo;t express myself that I can in English. I feel like I can&rsquo;t connect with people when speaking in Spanish in the same way that I can with English-speaking friends, which is a bit frustrating. I&rsquo;m considering taking Spanish classes to improve my language abilities. <em>(I&rsquo;m so happy I ended up taking classes!)</em></p>
<p>Things have been inevitably frustrating at times: when I misspeak in Spanish, or when I think I said something correctly, but someone still speaks English back to me. When I realize I&rsquo;ve been doing something one way but there was a much easier way. Having to deal with Spanish bureaucracy (don&rsquo;t get me started on empadronamiento or tarjeta identidad extranjeria). But it&rsquo;s kind of cool that my first time adulting for real is here, because it&rsquo;s going to be amazing to go back to America and know with conviction that the bottled sauce I bought is indeed for pasta, or negotiate a lease in my native language, or to be able to find things like tofu and edamame easily. Things haven&rsquo;t been always easy, but I am so grateful for these experiences.</p>
<p>In terms of what&rsquo;s ahead - my parents are visiting soon and we&rsquo;re going to go to Barcelona (or maybe not, because there&rsquo;s a lot of protests happening there right now&hellip;we&rsquo;ll see) and Madrid and I&rsquo;m so excited! Down the line, some friends are going to be spending part of their winter break in Spain which I cannot wait for. I might also make a trip to La Rioja with Aiko to basically just do a bunch of wine tasting sometime in November. Basically, I&rsquo;ll be traveling a little more than every other weekend and then coming home for Christmas, so the rest of 2019 is going to be crazy in the most wonderful way possible. <em>(I&rsquo;m happy that I traveled while I could.)</em></p>
