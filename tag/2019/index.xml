      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally written January 2020&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so happy to go home for the holidays, even though I had to experience a taste of Minnesota winter. It was incredible to be with my family and see friends back home, as always, but it felt especially comforting to have the familiarity and ease of being around the people I&amp;rsquo;ve grown up with who speak English the same way I do. One of the biggest highlights was food - as a vegetarian, traditional Spanish cuisine is not the best for me, and Spain also lacks good Asian food, so I relished in going to all my favorite restaurants back home and eating my mom&amp;rsquo;s food. Another highlight was trying out a free week of hot yoga with my sister and generally getting to spend time with her. Overall, I  realized that there are things in America I love and feel more comfortable with, but there were also things about Spain I missed too, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready to leave Spain (and I&amp;rsquo;m still not&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a hard transition back to America). &lt;em&gt;(My transition back ended up being so premature and jarring in a very different way from how I expected.)&lt;/em&gt; Right after New Years, I stopped in NYC for about 48 hours on the way back to meet up with some friends for a truly glorious 48 hours. I&amp;rsquo;m impressed at how much food I was able to consume in those 48 hours. We also discovered a really cool speakeasy and overall had the best time! &lt;em&gt;(Rip NYC - it&amp;rsquo;s crazy that I was there so recently. Definitely happy that I enjoyed it while I could.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to Spain on January 5 so that I could spend January 6, &lt;em&gt;Dia de los Reyes&lt;/em&gt;, with my friend Cristina and her family, who live just outside of Madrid. &lt;em&gt;Dia de los Reyes&lt;/em&gt; is the most important day of Christamas in Spain - the day where everyone opens their presents, and then eats &lt;em&gt;roscon&lt;/em&gt;, a traditional cake. It was very cool to experience Christmas as they do. My family doesn&amp;rsquo;t do traditional Christmas gifts, so it was fun to do that with her family (they were very generous!). Her family is the sweetest and I had a lovely time despite the jet lag.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I went back to Zaragoza for 5 days before I was off to India for a whirlwind 6 day trip! Those few days were truly a warm, crazy fever dream. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really sleep but I did eat so much good food (I really forget how amazing Indian food in India is) and saw an insane amount of family members. My family in India consists of a few hundred people and so the majority of my trip was just me trying to remember the names of the relative I was talking to&amp;hellip;we really need a pocket family tree.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://neerja.me/img/nitya_swatis.jpg&#34; data-caption=&#34;Reunited with my favorite person after a whole week apart, and also with some of my favorite food!&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Reunited with my favorite person after a whole week apart, and also with some of my favorite food!
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two major highlights of the trip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, going to Ahmedabad, where my nana (grandfather on mom&amp;rsquo;s side) grew up and my mom frequently went as a child. We have some family there that I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen that much, so it was nice to see them. Some of them live in a house that has a backyard with trees that grow little baby guavas and real peacocks that hang out there! There was also a kite flying festival when we visited, where all the kids (and many adults) fly kites all day and night. During the day, people try to &amp;ldquo;cut&amp;rdquo; other people&amp;rsquo;s kites out of the sky (the kite strings are made with broken glass and so you can also easily cut yourself while flying a kite), and at night, people string lanterns on kites. Lots of safety/fire hazards, but still an amazing time, and very pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    The kites at night were so beautiful!
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, the wedding, which was mostly why we were there. Indian weddings are INSANE. This wedding was only 2.5 days long, and it was the shortest Indian wedding I&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard of - it&amp;rsquo;s not unusual for most weddings to take place over 5 days or even a week. There were 4 different functions, so I of course had to wear 4 different outfits. One of my favorite parts was the &lt;em&gt;bharat&lt;/em&gt;, where the groom&amp;rsquo;s family dances in the streets directly before the actual wedding ceremony. My dad is such a child at heart and it&amp;rsquo;s adorable - he especially enjoyed a lot of the wedding. Overall, it was fun to be surrounded by so much family, and to see my dad with all the people he grew up with!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally written December 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holiday season in Spain was incredible! I could feel the spirit in the air in a much more visceral way than when I was in America. This was definitely due to everyone&amp;rsquo;s joyful attitudes, but also in part due to the Christmas markets and decorations - all of the cities put up gorgeous lights.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over their winter break, more of my Dartmouth friends came to Spain. Two of them came to visit me in Zaragoza, and then we went to Barcelona together and met up with a few more friends! By that point, I was very comfortable in Zaragoza, so it was a blast to show them around the city, introduce them to my Spanish friends, and take them to my favorite bars for &lt;em&gt;juepincho&lt;/em&gt;. It is so special to share a place you love with people you love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barcelona was a blast, as always. &lt;em&gt;(And it would just keep on getting better&amp;hellip;that city has a very special place in my heart).&lt;/em&gt; We ate a lot of good food (finding great Korean food in Barcelona was a dream come true), did a Freixenet &lt;em&gt;cava&lt;/em&gt; tasting and tour, and explored some parts of the city I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen before. The highlight was definitely taking my Dartmouth friends to a party with all of the 10 or so Barcelona Fulbright researchers. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve had a chance to actually see and get to know them more, I adore the other Fulbright grantees. We had a ton of fun that night just talking until it didn&amp;rsquo;t even make sense to leave my friend&amp;rsquo;s apartment and go to a bar, and it made me very excited that I&amp;rsquo;ll be returning to Barcelona in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for visiting friends, I had the best time with you guys! Here are some photos from our adventures in Barca:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my friends left, I had a little over a week in Zaragoza before I headed home for the holidays. In this time we had a lab Christmas dinner, which was a lot of fun - after a blissfully early 8 pm dinner we all went to a bar for 4 full hours. I had an amusing conversation in Spanish with the head PI of my lab about the Minnesota Vikings (which he became a fan of during a year abroad in the Midwest but I know very little about - but my dad is a huge fan so when I told him about this he was thrilled) around 2 am. In addition to festivities with the lab, one of the woman in Aiko&amp;rsquo;s class who is from Vietnam opened an incredible Vietnamese restaurant, so we all started going there a lot. We also had a group Christmas dinner there -  I guess people are really into Christmas dinner here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I was all of a sudden back in Madrid for a night before an early morning flight back home! By a stroke of luck there ended up being a Fulbright party the one Wednesday night I was in Madrid, so I got a chance to see a lot of my research friends, as well as meet a bunch of the english teaching assistant grantees. This year has already made me a lot better at navigating parties/cocktails where I don&amp;rsquo;t know a lot of people - I used to be very shy when meeting new people, but now I have a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the end of 2019 in Spain was a great time. I also did some work that month too, but for once, not that much work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally written December 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, so much has been happening, that it&amp;rsquo;s been hard to keep up with regular emails. So here are some highlights from the end of October to November:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents visited! I guess they are coping with now being empty nesters by traveling more? The timing worked out nicely because I got to spend my birthday with them, the weather was nice, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too touristy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was Barcelona. They did all the touristy stuff, and on my birthday we went to Montserrat and then the Sagrada Familia which are both absolutely stunning, so we basically went to the prettiest places in the world that day. That night, we had some amazing &lt;em&gt;paella&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;vino&lt;/em&gt; for dinner, and then after a little too much wine I ran to the train station and thought I was going to miss my train, but turns out the train station was shut down due to protests (from the Catalan independence movement), so that was a bit of an adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some photos from our time in Catalunya:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Montserrat is beautiful
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we went to Zaragoza. Zaragoza isn&amp;rsquo;t that big so I already felt like I knew at least the center of the city really well, and it was so fun to be able to show them around. Apparently my dad was at first very skeptical of Zaragoza, but after seeing it and doing the few touristy things you can do here, he &amp;ldquo;was very impressed&amp;rdquo;. Both of my parents ended up loving the city. &lt;em&gt;(Wow, I miss Zaragoza.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we went to Madrid, which was so much fun. We had a nice dinner with the host families me and Nitya had when we did a Spanish exchange program in high school, and overall had a great time in the city! One highlight was going to a Thai restaurant - I had been craving good Thai for a while, since most Spanish cities really lack Asian food of any type. I love discovering more cool spots and delicious new restaurants every time I visit Madrid and Barcelona, which has ended up being quite a bit already. &lt;em&gt;(And it would just be more and more - I really miss both of those cities now, but I&amp;rsquo;m also really happy with how well I know them now.)&lt;/em&gt; Also, we went to Toledo, which is absolutely breathtaking - I would highly recommend going there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once my parents left, a lot of other events and new friendships made Zaragoza really start to feel like home, and led to a lot of fun memories being made!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to Logroño, the capital of &lt;em&gt;La Rioja&lt;/em&gt;, the region of Spain where &lt;em&gt;rioja&lt;/em&gt; wine is made. Aiko and I roadtripped with Miguel, one of my lab friends. We all bonded a lot singing along to random songs and going to a &lt;em&gt;bodega&lt;/em&gt; tour/wine tasting together, tried &lt;em&gt;pinchos&lt;/em&gt; typical to &lt;em&gt;La Rioja&lt;/em&gt;, and overall had a very lovely day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met a new friend from Florida through mutual friends and we immediately hit it off. She&amp;rsquo;s here through the &lt;em&gt;auxiliares&lt;/em&gt; program, which is similar to the english teaching branch of the Fulbright program. As much as I have appreciated and enjoyed primarily spending my time with Spanish people and other non-Americans, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have other people who better understand what you&amp;rsquo;re going through. She also knows a lot of people through the &lt;em&gt;auxiliares&lt;/em&gt; and erasmus programs, so I&amp;rsquo;ve met a lot of new people through her. One highlight of this was eating pizza that Italian erasmus students made&amp;hellip;it was very good pizza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to get closer to people in Zaragoza. Aiko&amp;rsquo;s Spanish class hangs out a lot and we started doing frequent Sunday potluck lunches. I started going to &lt;em&gt;juepincho&lt;/em&gt; (extra cheap &lt;em&gt;pinchos&lt;/em&gt; (tapas) hopping on Thursday, 1-2 euros for a drink and food!) almost every week. My favorite vegetarian pinchos are &lt;em&gt;croquetas de boletus&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;queso de cabra&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;champinones&lt;/em&gt; (grilled mushrooms with garlic and salt on bread), and any of the selections of cheese at a bar entirely dedicated to different kinds of cheese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanksgiving made me feel a bit homesick &lt;em&gt;(now it seems weird that I felt homesick, when now I&amp;rsquo;ve been home for much more than I thought I ever would)&lt;/em&gt;, since that&amp;rsquo;s normally the one time I&amp;rsquo;m always home, but knowing that I was going home for the holidays just 3 weeks later made it better. On Thanksgiving day I had dinner with some friends at a Mexican restaurant in Zaragoza - that describes the absurdity and magic of this year and I love it. I also had a lovely friendsgiving with my new American friend and some other &lt;em&gt;auxiliares&lt;/em&gt; that weekend where we cooked an amazing meal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I started taking Spanish lessons at a language school here, which has been extremely helpful for grammatical concepts I had forgotten. It&amp;rsquo;s truly a throwback to high school with all of the worksheets and conversation/listening activities, and has helped me noticeably improve my Spanish!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally written November 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late November, the Fulbright research seminar gave me an incredible weekend in Madrid. &lt;em&gt;(Wow, I have a lot of nostalgia for that weekend.)&lt;/em&gt; The Spanish Fulbright Commission brought us all to Madrid for a couple of days to talk about our research and hang out, and it was a ton of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My weekend started on a Thursday: two of my college friends visited Spain, so I got to Madrid a day early to hang out. It felt surreal to hear stories that mentioned &amp;ldquo;flitzes&amp;rdquo; (a flirty blitz - asking someone out via email), a term that only exists very specifically within the Dartmouth bubble, after so many weeks without even talking to any Americans. We spent a great afternoon and evening walking around the city, going to museums, and getting tapas. Three highlights: getting some delicious sangria at a tapas bar, finally going to the &lt;em&gt;Museo Reina Sofia&lt;/em&gt;, and discovering the best chocolate croissant of my life the next morning at my friend Jiachen&amp;rsquo;s recommendation to try out the famous and very crowded Madrid bakery La Mallorquina. &lt;em&gt;(I definitely made it back to that bakery in future trips to Madrid).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I parted ways with my friends, it was time for the research seminar! Everyone was arriving at different times, so after checking into the hotel, me and a few other Fulbrighters walked around and discovered an amazing place with great healthy, vegetarian options. Then, after a quick cafe con leche, we made our way to the university where the seminar was held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seminar consisted of a mix of remarks from alumni, people at the commission and even someone from the embassy, small group workshops, poster presentations, and individual presentations. It was great to reconnect with everyone, hear about the research they were getting into, and hear about how they were adjusting to living in their various cities in Spain. I loved learning about my fellow grantee&amp;rsquo;s research projects, spanning disciplines from the implications of fashion in Spanish history to using complex systems to model the behavior of ants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to orientation, I felt a lot less overwhelmed, and that I actually knew people better this time, so gatherings felt much less like networking events and more like a wonderful chance to hang out and catch up. The moments throughout the seminar where we got to talk and the big dinner most of us went out to didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like nearly enough. Every conversation felt meaningful, whether it was about marathon training or interdisciplinary research or Spanish politics or adjusting to our host cities. I had assumed that the other grantees would be very accomplished and interesting, and that assumption was proved extremely true as I got to know them, but I also got to see how passionate, caring and kind the other Fulbrighters are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the second day of the seminar, I got to present my research. I don&amp;rsquo;t love public speaking and felt a bit nervous, but this was a really great opportunity. After I presented many friends, even some with non-STEM backgrounds, told me that felt like they had an idea of what I was doing with my research, which was pretty awesome :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seminar ended with a Thanksgiving lunch, which was the sweetest ending note possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night after the seminar, I stayed in Madrid and hung out with Fulbright friends. One of my new Fulbright friends who is doing her Master&amp;rsquo;s in the city graciously hosted me, and I had a lovely time getting to know her better. A bunch of us went out to the famous &lt;em&gt;Teatro Barceló&lt;/em&gt; until 6 am (I said I would do it once, and now I never want to again) and it was a fun experience. Not quite as fun, but still an experience, was waking up at 11 am the next morning for the Spanish Civil War tour. A Fulbright grantee who is currently doing his PhD in Spanish history led us around Madrid and showed us places of significance in the Spanish Civil War - so cool and a unique view of a city I&amp;rsquo;m getting to know and love. Overall, lots of memories were made and much bonding occurred that weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally written October 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fiestas del Pilar,&lt;/em&gt; commonly called &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;pilares&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; is an ~11 day long citywide festival in Zaragoza. For these 11 days, there are concerts and events from 8 am to early into the next morning (basically 8 am to 7 am). The biggest event happened towards the end, on Saturday 12/10 (look at me using European dates now - that&amp;rsquo;s October 12) with the &lt;em&gt;ofrenda de flores&lt;/em&gt;, but there were countless social, religious and cultural events throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never experienced anything similar in the US. Let me start by describing the city of Zaragoza a bit more, to situate &lt;em&gt;pilares&lt;/em&gt;: Zaragoza seems to be optimized for socialization. One central tram line runs down the city, and along it, there are endless plazas surrounded by restaurants with ample outdoor seating. You can walk through the main center of the city in about 20 minutes. One major plaza, Plaza España, leads into the &lt;em&gt;casco antiguo&lt;/em&gt;, or old town, known for its narrow, windy streets full of tapas bars. There are very few tourist attractions in this city - it&amp;rsquo;s all about the locals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except maybe this weekend, when hordes of people from the surrounding region of Aragon, and also Madrid, Barcelona, la Rioja and other places, came down for &lt;em&gt;pilares&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Pilares&lt;/em&gt; was a much bigger and culturally-rich version of Green Key, Dartmouth&amp;rsquo;s spring music festival, or any other music festival I&amp;rsquo;ve been to in the states. Instead of being 3 days, it was 11. Instead of being limited to a college campus, it was in the whole city, and you could walk for 45 mins through Zaragoza and hear different concerts throughout the whole walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of just college students celebrating, it was everyone. Entire families, elderly people, literal babies with their parents, college students, people of various ability levels, actually everyone. I loved how so many more partook in Pilar than I normally see when I went to bars/clubs in the US. &lt;em&gt;(This pattern holds for bars in general in Spain - it&amp;rsquo;s normal for whole families to go out together, young children included.)&lt;/em&gt; The amount of people that came out and filled the plazas was genuinely amazing. It was also funny to literally see a beer bottle on the ground next to a child in a stroller. Probably a consequence of people being around alcohol literally since infancy, the people here actually seem to party much more responsibly than I&amp;rsquo;m used to at Dartmouth. I expected everyone partying all the time to be gross, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see any excessive trash on the ground or vomit or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, some highlights of Pilar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First weekend: checked out some concerts and went to a food/music festival close to the city center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the week: Went to more concerts, hung out in the plaza, etc, but mostly tried to conserve my energy. One valuable thing I did take away from Dartmouth is to treat festivals like a marathon, not a sprint.&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-me-and-aiko-at-a-concert-held-by-the-city-wearing-the-red-and-black-bandanas-that-all-women-traditionally-wear-during-pilares&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many people were out at all times like wow look at this PACKED plaza: &lt;em&gt;(It&amp;rsquo;s crazy remembering this, the biggest crowd I ever saw, now in the time of coronavirus)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure &gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://neerja.me/img/pilares_plaza.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; &gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second weekend: More concerts and hanging out. The highlight was on Saturday, with the &lt;em&gt;ofrenda de flores&lt;/em&gt;, where lots of people participate in a parade that ends up with offering flowers, which is then arranged into a literal floral mountain. The flowers were incredible. Aiko decided to walk with the Japanese society of Aragon, so we met a bunch of people through that and ended the day at a cafe with new friends, which made for a very fun day.&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure &gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://neerja.me/img/flores.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; &gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, we went to an event with giant caricatures of famous Spanish people that we realized had a target audience of children aged 2-7, but was nonetheless still fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final day of festivities ended with some of the best fireworks I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. What a wonderful end to an amazing 11 days!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the next week we were all exhausted and got sick but it&amp;rsquo;s okay because basically from the beginning of October until New Year&amp;rsquo;s is lots of holidays (I have a long weekend for Halloween and a 4 day weekend at the beginning of December&amp;hellip;I love Spain).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally written October 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, here&amp;rsquo;s an update about everything in my non-work life, which for once is actually a very significant part of my life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m loving my apartment. We got a 4th roommate and her name is Genesis. She is from Venezuela but has lived in Spain for a few years and knows so much about life here that I am clueless about. For example, one night she suggested ordering in food, which I had somehow not realized was something you could do in Spain. And then she proceeded to show me 4 or 5 different apps that I had no idea existed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of other friends, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to know Aparna, a woman in Aiko&amp;rsquo;s intensive 20-hours-a-week Spanish class. She&amp;rsquo;s a professional yoga instructor from India and here to learn Spanish to take her yoga business to other countries (I&amp;rsquo;m being exposed to so many meaningful things people do with their lives that would have never occurred to me back at Dartmouth). Aparna, Aiko and I all go to the same gym and have had fun exploring the city together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Tapas y cerveza&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting how everyone I hang out with is at least about 4 years older than me - such a change from college! I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying meeting new people, but I still feel pretty connected to people far away (my favorite times of the day are tied between when I have my afternoon cup of coffee and when my family and close friends Sarah and Sean wake up and text me every day without fail). I&amp;rsquo;m also enjoying having more time to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been so cool to live and work with people from completely varied backgrounds. Almost every day at lunch with my labmates, we fall into talking about a given subject and how it compares in Spain vs the US vs France (we have a postdoc from Nice) - meal sizes/times, how leaders are elected, mushrooms, coffee, PhD programs, cheese, really anything&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s funny how the smallest things can be so different from place to place. And the small things really matter. For example, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that people here care more about waiting for others. If we&amp;rsquo;re walking back from a group meeting or lunch and someone for any reason wants to have a quick conversation with someone, we all wait for them and then walk back to our lab together. While this action is unnatural to me after a lifetime in America, I love the concept and practice of treating people like they are more important than maximal productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today during our post-lunch coffee break (a daily ritual here), we were talking about stereotypes people have about other countries. Someone said that Spain is known as being all about &amp;ldquo;siesta and fiesta&amp;rdquo; and honestly&amp;hellip;not an inaccurate way to describe my life. I&amp;rsquo;m actually learning how to chill! (I do have some problems with the concept of &amp;ldquo;chill&amp;rdquo; the way it is frequently used, but I think that relaxing is nice.) When I was in college, I would do work all the time, even on breaks. But now, I&amp;rsquo;ve actually decided to stop working when I leave work, and to relax over the weekends, and to prioritize my sleep and health and friendships over or at least on par with work. I know that there&amp;rsquo;s so much more to life than work, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t always lived my life that way, and right now is the perfect time for me to develop a sustainable balance. I left Dartmouth so burnt out and don&amp;rsquo;t want to feel the same way during/after my PhD, because life is too short to be exhausted and stressed out all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking Spanish has been an adventure. I have a certain sense of humor in English, and I also have a sense of humor in Spanish (or maybe I just make people laugh by sounding stupid), but they&amp;rsquo;re distinct. The way I form thoughts in English is so different from how I have to think through Spanish, and speaking a lot of Spanish has deepened my appreciation of the ease of speaking in my native language. I feel like my Spanish is improving but not as much as I want it to. When I speak with groups of Spainards, I still have a hard time understanding what they are saying, and coming up with responses in the pace of the conversation. When I speak one-on-one with people, I can have a pretty full conversation and am sometimes surprised at perfect phrases I whip out, but there&amp;rsquo;s a depth at which I can&amp;rsquo;t express myself that I can in English. I feel like I can&amp;rsquo;t connect with people when speaking in Spanish in the same way that I can with English-speaking friends, which is a bit frustrating. I&amp;rsquo;m considering taking Spanish classes to improve my language abilities. &lt;em&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;m so happy I ended up taking classes!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things have been inevitably frustrating at times: when I misspeak in Spanish, or when I think I said something correctly, but someone still speaks English back to me. When I realize I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing something one way but there was a much easier way. Having to deal with Spanish bureaucracy (don&amp;rsquo;t get me started on empadronamiento or tarjeta identidad extranjeria). But it&amp;rsquo;s kind of cool that my first time adulting for real is here, because it&amp;rsquo;s going to be amazing to go back to America and know with conviction that the bottled sauce I bought is indeed for pasta, or negotiate a lease in my native language, or to be able to find things like tofu and edamame easily. Things haven&amp;rsquo;t been always easy, but I am so grateful for these experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of what&amp;rsquo;s ahead - my parents are visiting soon and we&amp;rsquo;re going to go to Barcelona (or maybe not, because there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of protests happening there right now&amp;hellip;we&amp;rsquo;ll see) and Madrid and I&amp;rsquo;m so excited! Down the line, some friends are going to be spending part of their winter break in Spain which I cannot wait for. I might also make a trip to La Rioja with Aiko to basically just do a bunch of wine tasting sometime in November. Basically, I&amp;rsquo;ll be traveling a little more than every other weekend and then coming home for Christmas, so the rest of 2019 is going to be crazy in the most wonderful way possible. &lt;em&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;m happy that I traveled while I could.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally written October 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe that I&amp;rsquo;ve been in Spain for over a month. It&amp;rsquo;s flown by, and strangely feels like this is my life now, and I&amp;rsquo;m loving it! There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of exciting non-work related stuff happening, but I&amp;rsquo;ll save that for the next update - I want to take this one to explain what I&amp;rsquo;m doing here work-wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://graphics.unizar.es/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Graphics and Imaging lab&lt;/a&gt; at University of Zaragoza. There are 3 or 4 professors in the lab, a handful of postdocs, and a decent amount of PhD students, making for a total of about 20 people, which is pretty large. The lab is full of incredibly smart, impressive people. &lt;em&gt;(In addition to being smart, they&amp;rsquo;re also very nice and fun - I ended up having some fun adventures with my lab mates and am still close to many of them).&lt;/em&gt; They publish at amazing conferences, collaborate with places such as MIT and Stanford (and Dartmouth), and the students intern at top graphics places in industry such as Adobe Research and Disney. I&amp;rsquo;m really honored to get to be working with people that know so much, and I&amp;rsquo;ve already learned a ton. They also seem to be very well-funded, and have encouraged me to attend a conference (there&amp;rsquo;s a few in France/Switzerland in the next few months), which is awesome and such a cool opportunity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m getting started on a really interesting project here: combining deep learning and compressed sensing, and important technique in signal processing. Here&amp;rsquo;s the basic idea of compressed sensing: Normally when we acquire a signal (I&amp;rsquo;ll use the example of taking a picture), we get way more data than we can actually transport, so we immediately compress it. So an image is always immediately reduced to a JPEG or another form, by finding all of the unimportant information and getting rid of it. With compressed sensing, we only acquire a small fraction of the information (so for a 100x100 pixel image, instead of getting values for all 10,000 pixels, we might just get values for 1,000 of them) through a measurement mask, and then we can reconstruct the original image. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fascinating math that shows that we can with very high probability reconstruct the image if certain conditions hold, and we can perform these computations in a reasonable amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-left-the-measurement-mask-used-to-capture-an-image-of-a-scene-middle-the-captured-image-with-missing-information-right-the-reconstructed-image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been some very cool results with this. One of my favorite is a paper where researchers took a single image, that to the naked eye just looks like a normal, slightly blurry photo, but were actually able to get pixels at slightly different times and then from that single photo reconstruct 30 frames for a resulting 1 second video! More recently, with the rise of machine learning, people are combining the mathematical basis of compressed sensing with neural networks to get amazing results in a lot of applications. So my research is generally within this area! I&amp;rsquo;ve only had one meeting for my project so far, but it went well, and I like the people I&amp;rsquo;m working with. &lt;em&gt;(It&amp;rsquo;s fun remembering the beginnings of my project, now seeing what it has evolved into.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of my daily/weekly schedule, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty much what I want. We have a weekly lab meeting, and I have regular meetings for my deep compressed sensing project. Aside from those meetings, there isn&amp;rsquo;t any time I am required to be in the lab, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found a regular schedule to be helpful. I also have a lot of flexibility to work remotely and take vacation when I want to, as long as it&amp;rsquo;s not in excess, which is really nice. My daily routine is typically something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~8:15 wake up, get ready&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9:00 head to take the tram to work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9:30 get to work, say hi to everyone, and start working. This involves a mixture of reading papers, coding, data analysis, and writing, depending on what I have to do for the day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:30 break for lunch. We all go eat together and take a full hour for lunch or sometimes more. This is an early lunch by Spanish standards, but the cafeteria fills up at 2 so we try to get there before that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2:30 hit the coffee machine after lunch. There&amp;rsquo;s a vending machine that will make you any sort of coffee/hot chocolate beverage you want (very common in Europe, we need these in America), but I prefer these machines - 40 cents for some of the best coffee! My lab mates think it&amp;rsquo;s unremarkable and that the bad coffee in America has ruined my standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;





  











&lt;figure &gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://neerja.me/img/coffee_machine.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; &gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~2:45/3, depending on how long a coffee break we take: back to work! Often around now I&amp;rsquo;ll start getting distracted because all my friends/family in the US will wake up and start sending me messages :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5:30 head out, though sometimes I stay longer if I have more to do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6:00 go to gym or go for a run!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7:30 make dinner, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to eat at 8:30/9 but often am hungry much earlier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9:00 until bedtime: sometimes more work if I have to, oftentimes reading/watching Spanish TV/talking to friends in America. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll go out for dinner or grab a drink with friends, which will always be at 9 pm or later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m loving this lifestyle. I might try to join a club or take formal Spanish lessons soon, but for now it&amp;rsquo;s nice to just focus on work and then on enjoying life. I adore doing research full time. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to not have to put time into classes and to be able to make doing research/learning what I need to learn for research my top priority. I love spending my days making progress on my projects and learning a TON and having freedom in what to work on. I&amp;rsquo;m learning a lot about my research style and strengths/weaknesses, which I think will be super helpful when I pursue my PhD back in America. There are definitely stressful points, when code doesn&amp;rsquo;t work or something doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense, or the fact that in research you&amp;rsquo;re literally trying to stretch the boundaries of knowledge which means a lot of times ideas won&amp;rsquo;t pan out. &lt;em&gt;(I ended up feeling these points a lot, but nontheless really enjoyed what I did).&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m also working on 2 projects right now, since I&amp;rsquo;m continuing a project I started at Dartmouth last year, but the intensity of Dartmouth prepared me well, and it&amp;rsquo;s so nice to focus on doing fewer things but doing them well. I also really like the lab environment - I&amp;rsquo;m so happy that I ended up here!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally written September 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After orientation, I hopped on the AVE (a high speed train, we really need this in America) and got to Zaragoza! I was exhausted from the combination of orientation and traveling with 2 suitcases that together weigh about as much as me, so I was ready to eat some food and crash. Despite being really hungry, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go into a restaurant, a little bit because I have a fear of eating alone in public, especially in a country as social as Spain, and mostly because most restaurants don&amp;rsquo;t serve dinner until 9 pm in Zaragoza. Wanting to find a grocery store to make some easy pasta, I typed grocery store in Google maps, and nothing came up. Then, I tried translating &amp;ldquo;grocery store&amp;rdquo; to Spanish, plugged that word in to maps, and the only things that came up were sex shops&amp;hellip;.so not helpful at all. I gave up and had some McDonalds for dinner. (The next day I realized I needed to be searching for &amp;ldquo;supermarket/supemercado&amp;rdquo;, oops). So my start to living in Zaragoza was sitting in my Airbnb alone eating some fries - hopefully it&amp;rsquo;ll all be uphill from there. &lt;em&gt;(Thankfully, it was all very uphill!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was busy the next several days with a lot of adult errands. I opened a bank account, and even before Fulbright had sent me my first payment, it was  exciting that my empty bank account said 0 euros instead of dollars - yay to no international transaction fees! I started the apartment hunt, going to places I had found on idealista. Thankfully, my Spanish somehow sufficed. The first 3 apartments I saw were: a place where 2 other Erasmus students lived (European college students that study abroad in other parts of Europe mostly so that they can party relentlessly for 6 months, and remember that the clubs are open until 7 am here), a place that reeked of cigarette smoke everywhere, and a place that had 4 boys living there (not for me). But then I found &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; apartment and luckily things worked out! I have lots of closet space, a dishwasher, a huge living room, air conditioning, and a kitchen that was gorgeous once we deep cleaned it. My roommates are awesome - there&amp;rsquo;s Miguel, a 29 year old from Madrid who is studying to become some sort of lawyer, and Aiko, a 25 year old from Japan who is here to learn Spanish so she can work in the ministry of foreign affairs in South America in a few years. We have a 4th roommate, and all I know about her is that she&amp;rsquo;s coming in a few days, but I&amp;rsquo;m excited to meet her!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found a really lovely gym right next to my apartment. It has 2 pools and a lot of fitness classes and even a spa all included and would probably be insanely expensive in America but since Zaragoza has a much lower cost of living I can easily afford it. I have absolutely no excuses to not work out a lot at this point, and am excited to try out the yoga and spin classes at the gym. I spent a lot of time cooking, which I&amp;rsquo;m loving - I&amp;rsquo;m slowly learning and able to make more advanced things, and it feels so great to cook healthy things for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So overall, even though there have been ups and downs as expected, I&amp;rsquo;m feeling good about my start in Spain. I&amp;rsquo;m actually loving the city of Zaragoza - it&amp;rsquo;s calm and non-touristy but also has a lot to do. It feels weird to have everyone I love thousands of miles away, and it can be hard to only speak in English some days over a WhatsApp or FaceTime call with a poor connection. There have been times I&amp;rsquo;ve felt a bit lonely, especially in contrast to the very social culture in Spain, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been grateful to always have my family or a friend to call. It&amp;rsquo;s been kind of nice to not know people (well, until I got roommates and started making friends) and have a good reason to just spend a lot of time with myself doing whatever I want to do - I can see why people like solo traveling. &lt;em&gt;(I remember that halfway through my Fulbright I reflected on this initial loneliness I felt as I walked through plazas in Zaragoza full of people socializing with each other, and being very grateful for all the new friends I had made that I explored the city with. It can be really fun to explore a place alone, but personally, I love having people to share the experience and grab a caña with.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have very few expectations and am excited to see where this year takes me. All I do know is that I&amp;rsquo;m going to do what I want to do and prioritize myself, and I&amp;rsquo;m really grateful to have this gift of a year in Spain to do just that!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally written September 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived to Madrid pretty exhausted off of a red eye, and went to the Airbnb I was going to stay in for the night with another Dartmouth &amp;lsquo;19 who got a Fulbright to be a TA in Asturias, a region in Northern Spain. I was pretty dead, but decided to head with them to a bar for a pre-orientation Fulbright event. The bar consisted of a lot of people my age talking very loudly and I was soon overwhelmed and exhausted at having to scream to converse, a common thread throughout orientation. I opted to not drink, since I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really eaten or slept. I was able to meet some people and they were all really nice, but I was happy to leave after an hour to go meet up with Cristina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cristina is my host sister from a 2-week Spanish exchange back in high school, and we&amp;rsquo;ve stayed in touch ever since. She just passed the exam to become a teacher, and she&amp;rsquo;s now teaching English to middle and high schoolers in Madrid. She&amp;rsquo;s one of the kindest and most genuine people I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met, and it&amp;rsquo;s so nice that I started my Fulbright with at least one friend within a 200 mile radius! We had dinner and went to a rooftop bar (which I enjoyed much more than the last rooftop bar that I went to, Mr. Purple, in NYC), and it was wonderful to catch up and talk about potential vacations &lt;em&gt;(I read the word vacations and first thought it said vaccinations - this pandemic is getting to me. Then I remembered there will be no more vacations for a long while)&lt;/em&gt; around Europe we could take together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then proceeded to knock out for 11 hours, which was very necessary because I had no idea how crazy orientation would be. Our days were packed with important info sessions and required social events from 7 am until past 9 pm, and then dinner time was after 9, per the Spanish eating schedule (a breakfast of basically just coffee at 7, a coffee break at 11, lunch at 2 or 3 or 4, and dinner around 10 pm + very little sleep - hence tons of coffee. This country seems a bit permanently jet lagged but so am I so it&amp;rsquo;s all good). I would drink at least 2 cups of coffee, but they make really strong espresso, and I more than once found my body literally shaking from caffeine. There were so many people to meet - it felt like college orientation all over again, except I knew I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to see most of these people again since we are all living in different parts of Spain &lt;em&gt;(spoiler alert: I was very wrong about this)&lt;/em&gt;. Every day we had a mandatory 7-9pm cocktail event, during which we were drinking free tinto (red wine + lemonade, very delicious) and cerveza (beer) on empty stomachs since we were hungry for dinner. I was pretty overwhelmed and delirious, and felt ungrateful for feeling that way because I also recognize that this is an incredible opportunity and was excited to meet so many really cool and passionate people, but I guess a need for sleep is valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The makeup of the Fulbrighters was interesting. The researchers group is fairly gender-balanced and about as diverse as Dartmouth (so, not that diverse, but also not all white), but the TAs were largely composed of white women. I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt that noticeably in the minority in a long time. Clearly, it&amp;rsquo;s a privilege to get a Fulbright, but it&amp;rsquo;s also a huge privilege to be able to do a Fulbright and choose a year of personal fulfillment and travel over a higher-paying job, and that shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m happy that I took notes during a lot of the sessions, because while my brain was only half functional during orientation, the information we received was  important and interesting. We learned what Fulbright expected of us - it&amp;rsquo;s really strict in some ways, for example we can&amp;rsquo;t leave Spain for more than 21 days, but also laid back in others, such as the fact that we don&amp;rsquo;t need to deliver any final product for our research (so while I definitely plan to do good work, work doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be my #1 priority at all times). Also, they told us we should definitely take weekends to relax and explore and definitely not do work - what a concept! &lt;em&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;m so happy that I used my weekends in Spain for things other than work.)&lt;/em&gt; We learned about a lot of differences between America and Spain. Everyone uses WhatsApp here, people are generally warmer, even in professional settings, drinking is a huge part of the culture in the way that people will even bring their children to bars, every region has festivals that last all night (and also clubs are open until 7 am - I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I can ever go clubbing here because they open at 2/3 am which is when I like to be solidly asleep).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently Spain is quite progressive when it comes to laws around and percentage of people that identify as queer, especially compared to America, which was great to hear. But it&amp;rsquo;s also far from perfect - they told us that there&amp;rsquo;s a tradition in Spain as part of a festival where people wear blackface, and that it&amp;rsquo;s normal for people to joke about things that would be considered very offensive in the US. I have no idea how much of that is really true, and am interested to see what my experience will be like, especially since Zaragoza is not diverse. While the conversation the presentations started was not very in depth, I did approve of the message they promoted about trying to respect where other people are coming from while also asserting our own boundaries and explaining why certain things are not okay for us, when we feel comfortable engaging. I  believe that everyone has their beliefs in large part because of how they were raised and socialized, and that hopefully if I encounter anything unfortunate it can be a starting point for conversations where people can learn and grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to meet all the other researchers and hear about their projects, which was cool. Out of the 25, there are 2 other CS researchers. The split between humanities and STEM research is pretty even. A lot of the researchers are currently doing their PhD, and they know so much about what they are studying so it was super interesting to get to talk to them! &lt;em&gt;(It&amp;rsquo;s so fun to read this, now knowing the friends mentioned here so much better.)&lt;/em&gt; One is going to be excavating ceramics to search for signs of a plague before the bubonic plague in Barcelona. Another is going to collect nuts in a forest in Granada to get data for her ecology project. I spent a lot of time talking to this awesome woman who just graduated from Harvard law and knows so much about Spanish law and random facts about Spain (do you know that Spain is on the wrong time zone because Franco wanted Spain to have the same time zone as Nazi Germany? More support for this country literally being jet lagged). One guy who is finishing his biophysics PhD at MIT just got married to a Spanish woman he met when she did an exchange at Harvard! What a cool group of people - it&amp;rsquo;s too bad that I&amp;rsquo;m not in the same city as any of them, but we have an active WhatsApp group and a few more meetups than the rest of Fulbright Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orientation passed by in a blur, but the last presentation stuck out, from the American consulate in Spain. They said some stuff to scare us, but I really feel like Spain is much safer than America&amp;hellip;there are basically no guns here, and while Spain has a &amp;ldquo;medium&amp;rdquo; terrorism threat, the US is much higher. The really stupid things Americans have done in Spain was very entertaining. One guy took a lot of illegal drugs in Ibiza and is currently in Spanish prison, so basically do NOT take a pill in Ibiza. Another guy went to visit a friend, went clubbing with his passport, lost his passport and phone, got separated from his friend and didn&amp;rsquo;t know where his friend lived in and so he went to the consulate, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t log into his Facebook to message his friend or remember his mother&amp;rsquo;s phone number so she could wire him money. Thankfully, emergency contacts exist. Also, don&amp;rsquo;t go clubbing with your passport.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally written September 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 11 posts in my &amp;ldquo;Neerja en España&amp;rdquo; series will be very lightly edited emails that I sent my friends while I was in Spain. Since a lot has changed since I wrote them, I&amp;rsquo;m adding retrospective comments in italics to the posts that I wrote while I was living through them. Here&amp;rsquo;s the first email I sent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summer after graduation flew by between cherished time at home, travels to Europe with family, and a trip to the East Coast with my best friend to visit some of our college friends who started work. Now I&amp;rsquo;m in Spain, which has already been crazy, but I first wanted to explain what the Fulbright actually is and what I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two broad kinds of Fulbright grants: the English teaching assistant grant (ETA), and the research/masters grant (which I am here on). For both grants, Fulbright pays us a stipend for living expenses and facilitates us getting a visa into Spain and setting us up. Spain has the second-largest Fulbright program, with over 150 ETAs and about 30 research/masters students. The ETAs are all placed in one of 6 regions of Spain where they are assigned a school and teach classes for about 20 hours a week. The research/masters students are all over Spain, since we got to choose our host institution as part of our project proposals. The majority of us are in Madrid or Barcelona, but there are a few like me who are in other cities, such as Seville, Salamanca, Granada, and Leon. After a few days orientation in Madrid, we all go to our respective cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m the only Fulbright student in my city, Zaragoza. Zaragoza is a medium sized city (~700K people), located right in between Madrid and Barcelona - it&amp;rsquo;s a little over an hour on the high speed AVE train to either city (&lt;em&gt;I ended up taking the AVE so many times, and loving it more and more each time)&lt;/em&gt;. Even though it&amp;rsquo;s smaller, it definitely has everything I need, and has a lot to explore, especially compared to Hanover. Also, apparently Zaragoza has the highest amount of bars/clubs per capita in all of Spain. Zaragoza is much less touristy than most other cities its size or bigger in Spain, which is really nice, since the cost of living is lower here and I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to actually immerse myself in Spanish culture. One of Zaragoza&amp;rsquo;s most famous attractions is the huge basilica - here&amp;rsquo;s a photo of it:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty nervous to be the only one in my city, since I know literally no one here and don&amp;rsquo;t have an automatic cushion of American Fulbrighters to fall back on. I expect the first month or so to be a little rough. However, I think that it&amp;rsquo;ll overall be good for me, since I&amp;rsquo;ll hopefully form deeper friendships with people that are not American, which is important to me, and in the meantime I&amp;rsquo;m grateful FaceTime exists! &lt;em&gt;(I ended up befriending many non-Americans, and while I was apprehensive I am so grateful that I specifically ended up in Zaragoza)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of my actual project, I will be doing research somewhere within the convex hull of graphics, vision, and computational photography. I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure what my project will be, but the lab I&amp;rsquo;ll be working in at Universidad de Zaragoza does a lot of very cool things, so I&amp;rsquo;m excited to get working! I&amp;rsquo;m not sure exactly what my schedule will be like, but I should be doing the same amount of work equivalent to a 9 to 5 job, working in the lab every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year is really going to be what I make of it, in every way. In terms of work, Fulbright doesn&amp;rsquo;t expect us to create any sort of final product with our research, as long as we are working on it consistently. So while publishing a paper would be nice, it&amp;rsquo;s in no way required. I definitely want to get great work done and learn more about my research interests and style, but aside from near deadlines, I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to work as intensely as I will be during my PhD. In terms of the rest of my life, I have a lot of freedom, and I definitely want to use this year in a lot of ways. When I studied abroad in Budapest, I was essentially an American tourist in Budapest and only made friends with other American students, and I absolutely don&amp;rsquo;t want this year to be a repeat of that. My top personal goals/to-dos include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve my Spanish (I&amp;rsquo;ve been pleasantly surprised at how decent it is, but I still have a ways to go in becoming totally fluent)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve my cooking abilities and make my health a priority - sleep a lot and work out regularly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make non-American friends and expose myself to new perspectives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travel to a lot of places in Spain! I&amp;rsquo;m only allowed to leave the country for 21 days, but there&amp;rsquo;s so much to see just in Spain that I&amp;rsquo;ll still be able to travel a ton. I already have the Asturias, southern Spain and the Canary islands at the top of my list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;m really happy that I ended up achieving all of these goals to a pretty good extent, except for the places I traveled to ended up being different - I very sadly did not make it to Asturias, Andalucia, or Las Canarias)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that answers some of the questions you guys have been asking me and gives you a sense of what I&amp;rsquo;ll be up to for the next year!&lt;/p&gt;
