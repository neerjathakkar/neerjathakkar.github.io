After taking a year off, I am extremely happy that I did so - it allowed me to recover from burnout after undergrad, explore a new country, meet a lot of new people, and learn a lot that made me feel much more prepared to start my PhD. Therefore, I would strongly recommend considering a gap year. However, deciding how to spend a year off can be tricky. I considered several options, and talked to my professors and older students about them. Here are some bits of advice I gleaned and my thoughts on a non-exhaustive list of ways to spend a year or two before starting a PhD.\nWork in industry\nPros: You can gain relevant experience and save a lot of money. You can also see if you enjoy software engineering or other traditional roles in tech companies - if you think you would be happier in those jobs, it\u0026rsquo;s probably not worth getting a PhD.\nCons: Since you probably won\u0026rsquo;t be doing research, this won\u0026rsquo;t be as significant a boost to your application as other gap year possibilities. Once you get used to working at a tech company with perks and a large salary for a while, it can be hard to go back to a student lifestyle.\nDo research for a year\nPros: By doing research, you\u0026rsquo;ll get to figure out if you truly like research and want to make a career out of it. More research experience should also be a big boost to your PhD applications, especially if you can publish, and will help you be better prepared for your PhD. You will get to make connections in academia (which is surprisingly small, and can be a huge benefit when you are considering grad school).\nCons: It can be hard to find research experiences outside of specific academic programs or fellowships, since many professors prefer to work with their PhD/masters/undergrad students.\nDo research for a year, on a fellowship\nPros: All of the pros of doing research for a year. Additionally, when you do research on a fellowship, you should have more choice in deciding what you do - you often get to propose your own research project. Through a fellowship, you will be able to make a lot of great connections with other people. You might also get the chance to live abroad, since many fellowships are international.\nCons: The application process is often extensive and many fellowships are very selective.\nGet a Masters\nPros: Many of the same benefits as doing research for a year (be sure to look into a research vs course-based masters). You\u0026rsquo;ll get to take advanced courses of your choosing and hone your research interests.\nCons: For most programs, you will have to pay (however, be sure to look into 4+1 programs at your undergraduate institution, which are sometimes discounted, and fellowships such as Fulbright that fund Master\u0026rsquo;s programs, and generally Masters programs abroad, since American tuition is more expensive than that of many fantastic universities abroad). Many PhD programs will have higher expectations of you to have at least one, if not more, publications when you apply, compared to applicants with just an undergrad degree. Also, most PhD programs will still require you to take courses when you get there, and so you will likely add additional years of school.\nMy Gap Year\nI navigated all of this by applying to my 4 top-choice PhD programs, and also applying to fellowships alongside them. I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect to get into any PhD programs, but I was hoping that a fellowship would work out so that I could do more research and strengthen my application. If nothing worked out, my plan was to try to work in industry for a year, or maybe do a masters program.\nLuckily, I ended up getting into a couple of my top choice programs, and also getting a Fulbright fellowship. I committed to UC Berkeley and deferred for a year so that I could do the Fulbright. My year off was so much more than I expected it to be, and I would highly recommend considering a gap year (or a few) before jumping into a PhD. I\u0026rsquo;m now going into my PhD feeling much more prepared, well rested, and convinced that doing a PhD is right for me.\n","date":1590294667,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590294667,"objectID":"44adf2e5f8aeb1fe0f0a120f875a81ae","permalink":"https://neerjathakkar.github.io/post/phd_gap_year_options/","publishdate":"2020-05-23T23:31:07-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/phd_gap_year_options/","section":"post","summary":"A survey of different options to consider if you want to take time off between undergrad and your PhD","tags":["Fulbright","PhD Applications"],"title":"How to Spend A Pre-PhD Gap Year","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"After orientation, I hopped on the AVE (a high speed train, we really need this in America) and got to Zaragoza! I was exhausted from the combination of orientation and traveling with 2 suitcases that together weigh about as much as me, so I was ready to eat some food and crash. Despite being really hungry, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to go into a restaurant, a little bit because I have a fear of eating alone in public, especially in a country as social as Spain, and mostly because most restaurants don\u0026rsquo;t serve dinner until 9 pm in Zaragoza. Wanting to find a grocery store to make some easy pasta, I typed grocery store in Google maps, and nothing came up. Then, I tried translating \u0026ldquo;grocery store\u0026rdquo; to Spanish, plugged that word in to maps, and the only things that came up were sex shops\u0026hellip;.so not helpful at all. I gave up and had some McDonalds for dinner. (The next day I realized I needed to be searching for \u0026ldquo;supermarket/supemercado\u0026rdquo;, oops). So my start to living in Zaragoza was sitting in my Airbnb alone eating some fries - hopefully it\u0026rsquo;ll all be uphill from there. (Thankfully, it was all very uphill!)\nI was busy the next several days with a lot of adult errands. I opened a bank account, and even before Fulbright had sent me my first payment, it was exciting that my empty bank account said 0 euros instead of dollars - yay to no international transaction fees! I started the apartment hunt, going to places I had found on idealista. Thankfully, my Spanish somehow sufficed. The first 3 apartments I saw were: a place where 2 other Erasmus students lived (European college students that study abroad in other parts of Europe mostly so that they can party relentlessly for 6 months, and remember that the clubs are open until 7 am here), a place that reeked of cigarette smoke everywhere, and a place that had 4 boys living there (not for me). But then I found the apartment and luckily things worked out! I have lots of closet space, a dishwasher, a huge living room, air conditioning, and a kitchen that was gorgeous once we deep cleaned it. My roommates are awesome - there\u0026rsquo;s Miguel, a 29 year old from Madrid who is studying to become some sort of lawyer, and Aiko, a 25 year old from Japan who is here to learn Spanish so she can work in the ministry of foreign affairs in South America in a few years. We have a 4th roommate, and all I know about her is that she\u0026rsquo;s coming in a few days, but I\u0026rsquo;m excited to meet her!\nI also found a really lovely gym right next to my apartment. It has 2 pools and a lot of fitness classes and even a spa all included and would probably be insanely expensive in America but since Zaragoza has a much lower cost of living I can easily afford it. I have absolutely no excuses to not work out a lot at this point, and am excited to try out the yoga and spin classes at the gym. I spent a lot of time cooking, which I\u0026rsquo;m loving - I\u0026rsquo;m slowly learning and able to make more advanced things, and it feels so great to cook healthy things for myself.\nSo overall, even though there have been ups and downs as expected, I\u0026rsquo;m feeling good about my start in Spain. I\u0026rsquo;m actually loving the city of Zaragoza - it\u0026rsquo;s calm and non-touristy but also has a lot to do. It feels weird to have everyone I love thousands of miles away, and it can be hard to only speak in English some days over a WhatsApp or FaceTime call with a poor connection. There have been times I\u0026rsquo;ve felt a bit lonely, especially in contrast to the very social culture in Spain, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been grateful to always have my family or a friend to call. It\u0026rsquo;s been kind of nice to not know people (well, until I got roommates and started making friends) and have a good reason to just spend a lot of time with myself doing whatever I want to do - I can see why people like solo traveling. (I remember that halfway through my Fulbright I reflected on this initial loneliness I felt as I walked through plazas in Zaragoza full of people socializing with each other, and being very grateful for all the new friends I had made that I explored the city with. It can be really fun to explore a place alone, but personally, I love having people to share the experience and grab a caña with.)\nI have very few expectations and am excited to see where this year takes me. All I do know is that I\u0026rsquo;m going to do what I want to do and prioritize myself, and I\u0026rsquo;m really grateful to have this gift of a year in Spain to do just that!\n","date":1590208181,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590208181,"objectID":"dd662cab815e4df60797314446881e95","permalink":"https://neerjathakkar.github.io/post/neerja-espana-3/","publishdate":"2020-05-22T23:29:41-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/neerja-espana-3/","section":"post","summary":"My first few days in my new home: apartment hunting and adjusting","tags":["Fulbright","2019"],"title":"Neerja in España #3","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"I arrived to Madrid pretty exhausted off of a red eye, and went to the Airbnb I was going to stay in for the night with another Dartmouth \u0026lsquo;19 who got a Fulbright to be a TA in Asturias, a region in Northern Spain. I was pretty dead, but decided to head with them to a bar for a pre-orientation Fulbright event. The bar consisted of a lot of people my age talking very loudly and I was soon overwhelmed and exhausted at having to scream to converse, a common thread throughout orientation. I opted to not drink, since I hadn\u0026rsquo;t really eaten or slept. I was able to meet some people and they were all really nice, but I was happy to leave after an hour to go meet up with Cristina.\nCristina is my host sister from a 2-week Spanish exchange back in high school, and we\u0026rsquo;ve stayed in touch ever since. She just passed the exam to become a teacher, and she\u0026rsquo;s now teaching English to middle and high schoolers in Madrid. She\u0026rsquo;s one of the kindest and most genuine people I\u0026rsquo;ve ever met, and it\u0026rsquo;s so nice that I started my Fulbright with at least one friend within a 200 mile radius! We had dinner and went to a rooftop bar (which I enjoyed much more than the last rooftop bar that I went to, Mr. Purple, in NYC), and it was wonderful to catch up and talk about potential vacations (I read the word vacations and first thought it said vaccinations - this pandemic is getting to me. Then I remembered there will be no more vacations for a long while) around Europe we could take together.\nI then proceeded to knock out for 11 hours, which was very necessary because I had no idea how crazy orientation would be. Our days were packed with important info sessions and required social events from 7 am until past 9 pm, and then dinner time was after 9, per the Spanish eating schedule (a breakfast of basically just coffee at 7, a coffee break at 11, lunch at 2 or 3 or 4, and dinner around 10 pm + very little sleep - hence tons of coffee. This country seems a bit permanently jet lagged but so am I so it\u0026rsquo;s all good). I would drink at least 2 cups of coffee, but they make really strong espresso, and I more than once found my body literally shaking from caffeine. There were so many people to meet - it felt like college orientation all over again, except I knew I wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to see most of these people again since we are all living in different parts of Spain (spoiler alert: I was very wrong about this). Every day we had a mandatory 7-9pm cocktail event, during which we were drinking free tinto (red wine + lemonade, very delicious) and cerveza (beer) on empty stomachs since we were hungry for dinner. I was pretty overwhelmed and delirious, and felt ungrateful for feeling that way because I also recognize that this is an incredible opportunity and was excited to meet so many really cool and passionate people, but I guess a need for sleep is valid.\nThe makeup of the Fulbrighters was interesting. The researchers group is fairly gender-balanced and about as diverse as Dartmouth (so, not that diverse, but also not all white), but the TAs were largely composed of white women. I haven\u0026rsquo;t felt that noticeably in the minority in a long time. Clearly, it\u0026rsquo;s a privilege to get a Fulbright, but it\u0026rsquo;s also a huge privilege to be able to do a Fulbright and choose a year of personal fulfillment and travel over a higher-paying job, and that shows.\nI\u0026rsquo;m happy that I took notes during a lot of the sessions, because while my brain was only half functional during orientation, the information we received was important and interesting. We learned what Fulbright expected of us - it\u0026rsquo;s really strict in some ways, for example we can\u0026rsquo;t leave Spain for more than 21 days, but also laid back in others, such as the fact that we don\u0026rsquo;t need to deliver any final product for our research (so while I definitely plan to do good work, work doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be my #1 priority at all times). Also, they told us we should definitely take weekends to relax and explore and definitely not do work - what a concept! (I\u0026rsquo;m so happy that I used my weekends in Spain for things other than work.) We learned about a lot of differences between America and Spain. Everyone uses WhatsApp here, people are generally warmer, even in professional settings, drinking is a huge part of the culture in the way that people will even bring their children to bars, every region has festivals that last all night (and also clubs are open until 7 am - I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I can ever go clubbing here because they open at 2/3 am which is when I like to be solidly asleep).\nApparently Spain is quite progressive when it comes to laws around and percentage of people that identify as queer, especially compared to America, which was great to hear. But it\u0026rsquo;s also far from perfect - they told us that there\u0026rsquo;s a tradition in Spain as part of a festival where people wear blackface, and that it\u0026rsquo;s normal for people to joke about things that would be considered very offensive in the US. I have no idea how much of that is really true, and am interested to see what my experience will be like, especially since Zaragoza is not diverse. While the conversation the presentations started was not very in depth, I did approve of the message they promoted about trying to respect where other people are coming from while also asserting our own boundaries and explaining why certain things are not okay for us, when we feel comfortable engaging. I believe that everyone has their beliefs in large part because of how they were raised and socialized, and that hopefully if I encounter anything unfortunate it can be a starting point for conversations where people can learn and grow.\nI got to meet all the other researchers and hear about their projects, which was cool. Out of the 25, there are 2 other CS researchers. The split between humanities and STEM research is pretty even. A lot of the researchers are currently doing their PhD, and they know so much about what they are studying so it was super interesting to get to talk to them! (It\u0026rsquo;s so fun to read this, now knowing the friends mentioned here so much better.) One is going to be excavating ceramics to search for signs of a plague before the bubonic plague in Barcelona. Another is going to collect nuts in a forest in Granada to get data for her ecology project. I spent a lot of time talking to this awesome woman who just graduated from Harvard law and knows so much about Spanish law and random facts about Spain (do you know that Spain is on the wrong time zone because Franco wanted Spain to have the same time zone as Nazi Germany? More support for this country literally being jet lagged). One guy who is finishing his biophysics PhD at MIT just got married to a Spanish woman he met when she did an exchange at Harvard! What a cool group of people - it\u0026rsquo;s too bad that I\u0026rsquo;m not in the same city as any of them, but we have an active WhatsApp group and a few more meetups than the rest of Fulbright Spain.\nOrientation passed by in a blur, but the last presentation stuck out, from the American consulate in Spain. They said some stuff to scare us, but I really feel like Spain is much safer than America\u0026hellip;there are basically no guns here, and while Spain has a \u0026ldquo;medium\u0026rdquo; terrorism threat, the US is much higher. The really stupid things Americans have done in Spain was very entertaining. One guy took a lot of illegal drugs in Ibiza and is currently in Spanish prison, so basically do NOT take a pill in Ibiza. Another guy went to visit a friend, went clubbing with his passport, lost his passport and phone, got separated from his friend and didn\u0026rsquo;t know where his friend lived in and so he went to the consulate, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t log into his Facebook to message his friend or remember his mother\u0026rsquo;s phone number so she could wire him money. Thankfully, emergency contacts exist. Also, don\u0026rsquo;t go clubbing with your passport.\n","date":1590121781,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590121781,"objectID":"e2ff2b38eec41adcaaa2ca409933b0f8","permalink":"https://neerjathakkar.github.io/post/neerja-espana-2/","publishdate":"2020-05-21T23:29:41-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/neerja-espana-2/","section":"post","summary":"My first experience in Spain: Fulbright orientation","tags":["Fulbright","2019"],"title":"Neerja en España #2","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"When you look at the Fulbright website, you may notice that the amount of different programs you can apply to is huge. There are several axes of freedom where you have to make a decision: the country you apply in, the program you apply for (research/TA/masters), and if you do research, the host institution you work with and the research project you propose. It can feel overwhelming to decide which program to apply for and how to go about the process, so in this post I\u0026rsquo;m going to go over some things I considered and explain how I ended up making a decision. Most of this post will only be applicable for a research Fulbright as part of the US Student program, since that is what I applied for.\nThere are a lot of things to consider as you narrow down what you want to do. Here are some things that I kept in mind:\n The acceptance rate varies a lot by country and program. I was able to get some numbers from my school\u0026rsquo;s fellowship office (many universities will help you through this process - definitely use those resources if they are available to you!), and I realized that some countries had an extremely low acceptance rate for research/masters Fulbright\u0026rsquo;s (~2%), whereas others had a much higher acceptance rate (closer to a third of applicants were accepted) Read the page specific to a country you are considering very carefully. There are many variations by country and by programs within a country, such as:  Some countries have specific requirements (for example, you may need a masters to do research at a particular institution within a country) Some countries have a preference to fund certain kinds of academic fields, so you could be at an advantage or disadvantage Some countries have a language requirement or recommendation. Even if it\u0026rsquo;s a recommendation, it would be wise to only apply to that country if you have that competency   Host institution selection  What city is it in? Do you want to live in that city? Who within the host institution would you be working with? Can your host institution meet with you as often as you will need and give you the resources and support that you need? Would you be happy in this environment for 9 months?   Research project proposal  Even if your project is purely STEM, it needs to have some connection to where you are, since Fulbright is funding you for a project in a specific place Needs to be supported by host institution Does it meet your personal goals for skills you want to gain    With those considerations in mind, there are different approaches you could take. If you have a research project in mind that you want to undertake, you could think of a country/host institution where it would make sense to propose your research project to. Or, you could take the approach I did:\nI knew I wanted to do a research Fulbright in the field of computer science (more narrowly, within computer vision/graphics and computational photography). I also wanted to spend a year somewhere in Europe. Narrowing down countries by their acceptance rates, so that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t applying anywhere that generally took less than 10% of applicants, and also by looking for those where language wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a significant barrier, I decided to look for potential research labs in Spain and Switzerland.\nI found professors in those countries by reading previous work that interested me, and asked my research advisor at Dartmouth if he could send an email introducing me to these professors - he knew many of the ones I wanted to work with, and even for the ones he didn\u0026rsquo;t know, a cold email from another respected professor in the field often has a much higher chance of being read than one from a random student. We contacted one professor at a time, and I soon hit it off with the lab in Spain that I ended up working at. Together, we brainstormed a project that I could talk about in my Fulbright application, and soon I was drafting my proposal - more on that in my next post.\n","date":1590035377,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590035377,"objectID":"82e001c253e4b5824f6213fc9ea9c39b","permalink":"https://neerjathakkar.github.io/post/fulbright-app-1/","publishdate":"2020-05-20T23:29:37-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/fulbright-app-1/","section":"post","summary":"My first post on applying for a research Fulbright - some thoughts on how to decide what program to apply for and where to go to","tags":["Fulbright"],"title":"Applying for the Fulbright Part 1","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"The first 11 posts in my \u0026ldquo;Neerja en España\u0026rdquo; series will be very lightly edited emails that I sent my friends while I was in Spain. Since a lot has changed since I wrote them, I\u0026rsquo;m adding retrospective comments in italics to the posts that I wrote while I was living through them. Here\u0026rsquo;s the first email I sent:\nThe summer after graduation flew by between cherished time at home, travels to Europe with family, and a trip to the East Coast with my best friend to visit some of our college friends who started work. Now I\u0026rsquo;m in Spain, which has already been crazy, but I first wanted to explain what the Fulbright actually is and what I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing:\nThere are two broad kinds of Fulbright grants: the English teaching assistant grant (ETA), and the research/masters grant (which I am here on). For both grants, Fulbright pays us a stipend for living expenses and facilitates us getting a visa into Spain and setting us up. Spain has the second-largest Fulbright program, with over 150 ETAs and about 30 research/masters students. The ETAs are all placed in one of 6 regions of Spain where they are assigned a school and teach classes for about 20 hours a week. The research/masters students are all over Spain, since we got to choose our host institution as part of our project proposals. The majority of us are in Madrid or Barcelona, but there are a few like me who are in other cities, such as Seville, Salamanca, Granada, and Leon. After a few days orientation in Madrid, we all go to our respective cities.\nI\u0026rsquo;m the only Fulbright student in my city, Zaragoza. Zaragoza is a medium sized city (~700K people), located right in between Madrid and Barcelona - it\u0026rsquo;s a little over an hour on the high speed AVE train to either city (I ended up taking the AVE so many times, and loving it more and more each time). Even though it\u0026rsquo;s smaller, it definitely has everything I need, and has a lot to explore, especially compared to Hanover. Also, apparently Zaragoza has the highest amount of bars/clubs per capita in all of Spain. Zaragoza is much less touristy than most other cities its size or bigger in Spain, which is really nice, since the cost of living is lower here and I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to actually immerse myself in Spanish culture. One of Zaragoza\u0026rsquo;s most famous attractions is the huge basilica - here\u0026rsquo;s a photo of it:\n  from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Up_from_the_highest_tower_(16079304178).jpg   I\u0026rsquo;m pretty nervous to be the only one in my city, since I know literally no one here and don\u0026rsquo;t have an automatic cushion of American Fulbrighters to fall back on. I expect the first month or so to be a little rough. However, I think that it\u0026rsquo;ll overall be good for me, since I\u0026rsquo;ll hopefully form deeper friendships with people that are not American, which is important to me, and in the meantime I\u0026rsquo;m grateful FaceTime exists! (I ended up befriending many non-Americans, and while I was apprehensive I am so grateful that I specifically ended up in Zaragoza)\nIn terms of my actual project, I will be doing research somewhere within the convex hull of graphics, vision, and computational photography. I\u0026rsquo;m not exactly sure what my project will be, but the lab I\u0026rsquo;ll be working in at Universidad de Zaragoza does a lot of very cool things, so I\u0026rsquo;m excited to get working! I\u0026rsquo;m not sure exactly what my schedule will be like, but I should be doing the same amount of work equivalent to a 9 to 5 job, working in the lab every day.\nThis year is really going to be what I make of it, in every way. In terms of work, Fulbright doesn\u0026rsquo;t expect us to create any sort of final product with our research, as long as we are working on it consistently. So while publishing a paper would be nice, it\u0026rsquo;s in no way required. I definitely want to get great work done and learn more about my research interests and style, but aside from near deadlines, I don\u0026rsquo;t plan to work as intensely as I will be during my PhD. In terms of the rest of my life, I have a lot of freedom, and I definitely want to use this year in a lot of ways. When I studied abroad in Budapest, I was essentially an American tourist in Budapest and only made friends with other American students, and I absolutely don\u0026rsquo;t want this year to be a repeat of that. My top personal goals/to-dos include:\n Improve my Spanish (I\u0026rsquo;ve been pleasantly surprised at how decent it is, but I still have a ways to go in becoming totally fluent) Improve my cooking abilities and make my health a priority - sleep a lot and work out regularly Make non-American friends and expose myself to new perspectives Travel to a lot of places in Spain! I\u0026rsquo;m only allowed to leave the country for 21 days, but there\u0026rsquo;s so much to see just in Spain that I\u0026rsquo;ll still be able to travel a ton. I already have the Asturias, southern Spain and the Canary islands at the top of my list  (I\u0026rsquo;m really happy that I ended up achieving all of these goals to a pretty good extent, except for the places I traveled to ended up being different - I very sadly did not make it to Asturias, Andalucia, or Las Canarias)\nHopefully that answers some of the questions you guys have been asking me and gives you a sense of what I\u0026rsquo;ll be up to for the next year!\n","date":1590035377,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590035377,"objectID":"b73848b8a91ed58c4f171f3b655f3f0d","permalink":"https://neerjathakkar.github.io/post/neerja-espana-1/","publishdate":"2020-05-20T23:29:37-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/neerja-espana-1/","section":"post","summary":"An overview of Fulbright Spain and the year to come","tags":["Fulbright","2019"],"title":"Neerja en España #1","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1590034378,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590034378,"objectID":"a9f469c3ebef8d11cac2c3dace576616","permalink":"https://neerjathakkar.github.io/publication/balancing-sensitivity-specificity/","publishdate":"2020-05-20T23:12:58-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/balancing-sensitivity-specificity/","section":"publication","summary":"**Thakkar, N.**, and Bailey-Kellogg, C., BMC Bioinformatics, 2019","tags":[],"title":"Balancing sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing TCR groups by CDR sequence similarity","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Thanks for making your way to my blog! I am excited to see where this new adventure takes me.\nBy way of introducing myself: I grew up in St. Paul, Minnesota with my parents and my little sister, Nitya. In middle school and high school, most of my time outside of school was spent practicing the violin, doing bharatanatyam (a form of Indian dance), and being a part of the math team. In 2015, I moved to Hanover, New Hampshire, to start at Dartmouth College. There, I discovered computer science and fell in love with both a new way of thinking and the potential to make an important impact. I continued violin in my college orchestra and had a lot of fun spending time in the outdoors, getting into hiking and climbing. I also became very involved with sexual violence prevention, eventually serving as a chair on the Student and Presidential Committee on Sexual Assault. I graduated with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics, experiences both in academia and industry, and admission to the EECS PhD program at UC Berkeley.\nI was excited to start my PhD, but decided to defer for a year. After graduation, I moved to Zaragoza, Spain for a Fulbright research scholarship. I spent the most incredible 6 months in Spain before I had to leave early and return home due to the pandemic. I\u0026rsquo;ve been staying busy at home finishing up my Fulbright research remotely, and I\u0026rsquo;m trying to make the most of this time. I\u0026rsquo;ve been enjoying photography, running, reading, cooking, and now starting this blog.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been good about keeping a consistent journal for years, but when I was in Spain, I started writing more for other people. I sent semi-regular email updates to several friends and family about my adventures in Spain, and really enjoyed sharing what I was up to. I\u0026rsquo;ve also been asked by several people about the process of applying to Fulbright/grad school/scholarships, and I want to post information about that that is hopefully helpful to others, especially other women considering computer science. I have been incredibly fortunate to have so many wonderful mentors and access to resources at an elite institution, and I would love to share what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned with those who may not have as easy access to this information.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll be posting lightly edited versions of the emails I sent to my friends (but I won\u0026rsquo;t omit things I have since changed my mind about - it\u0026rsquo;s been fun to reread them and see how things evolved) covering most of my Fulbright experience in Spain, several posts about research/grad school/applying to Fulbright, and other things that come across my mind. If there is anything you would like to hear about, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to reach out!\n","date":1589948977,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589948977,"objectID":"69509d1e843731cf6dc0dbb8d2585208","permalink":"https://neerjathakkar.github.io/post/intro/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T23:29:37-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/intro/","section":"post","summary":"A little bit about who I am and what's going to be on this blog","tags":["2020"],"title":"Hello!","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"1f4cb24553577f6808a73065326a8b9d","permalink":"https://neerjathakkar.github.io/blog/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Neerja's Blog","type":"widget_page"}]
