**CS294-26 Project 1 - Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii Photo Collection** 

By Neerja Thakkar

Base Assignment
===============================================================================

Project Overview
----------------- 
Prokudin-Gorskii captured color photographs before color photography existed. He recorded three exposures of a scene, filtered with 
red, green and blue. The goal of this project is to take these three exposures and automatically process them to create a beautiful
color images of the Russian Empire in the early 1900s.

My Approach
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the single-scale approach, I searched over a window of offsets from [-15, 15] in the x and y direction. I selected the offsets 
that resulted in the highest normalized cross-correlation between the red/blue channel and the green channel. I only calculated the 
correlation on the middle 80% of each image, cropping 10% from each edge, so that the borders wouldn't interfere with the estimate.

For a multi-scale approach, I constructed an image pyramid with a maximum of 8 levels, starting with the full-resolution image, and then
down-scaling by factors of 2 at each level. I started at the coarsest scale, using my single-scale approach on this scale, and then
moved down the pyramid, passing the best estimate down. 

Except for the emir, this approach worked pretty well on all of the images, and was very fast. I hypothesize that the emir did not work
well because the different color channels had very different brightnesses, and therefore the NCC on just the luminance values within each 
channel was insufficient.

Bells and Whistles
===================

Automatic White Balance
------------------------ 
I implemented two simple automatic white balancing algorithms, using the White world and Gray world assumptions that were discussed in class.

It's interesting to see how much these two assumptions can impact an image - here's the same image balanced with the white world assumption,
which looks pretty good since the highlights in the clouds in the sky are a pure white, and the grey world assumption, which looks not as 
great because the blue sky/ocean become grey.

The grey world assumption worked better in the workshop image, where the average color was closer to gray.

Contrast
----------------------------------------------------------------
I first implemented a contrasting method where the user can pick a contrast value. I centered the image values around 0, 
mutliplied by a scale factor, and re-centered back to 0.5.
This led to some fun results, akin to playing with a 
contrast slider on Lightroom, that allow a user to have creative control over how their image looks.

I then implemented histogram equalization. The idea of histogram equalization is that an image that is improperly exposed
will have an uneven histogram of values, while "ideal" contrast (though of course this is subjective) will have an even histogram. 
We can equalize histograms by considering the CDF (the cumulative histogram) - if it is equalized, the CDF will be much closer
to a straight line.

This led to a fully automatic contrast that worked pretty well on some images.
I did the equalization on each channel individually, so I wonder if it would have been better if I combined the channels in a different way.

In this histogram of the red channel of the image, where blue is before equalization, and orange is after. You can see that the original histogram has 
too many values on the right side of the image, while not enough on the left side. The left side corresponds to darker parts of the image,
and the equalized version of the image has some darker parts. For example, I think that in the red curtains the contrast looks better in the 
equalized image.

Better features for alignment
------------------------------ 
Since there are many differences in brightness across the color channels, using NCC to compare and align channels isn't the best metric. This 
is especially the case for the emir image, where the alignment with NCC on RGB images was completely off.

The actual edges of the objects in the image seemed much more promising, so I used a Canny edge detector (implemented in scikit-image) on 
the image channels before aligning. This led to significantly better results, especially for the emir image!
